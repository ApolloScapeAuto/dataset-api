# The 3D Lidar Object Detection and Tracking Challenge of Apolloscape Dataset
Our 3D Lidar object detection and tracking dataset consists of LiDAR scanned point clouds with high quality annotation. It is collected under various lighting conditions and traffic densities in Beijing, China. More specifically, it contains highly complicated traffic flows mixed with vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.
The 3D Lidar object detection and tracking benchmark consists of about 53min training sequences and 50min testing sequences. The data is captured at 10 frames per second and labeled at 2 frames per second. We provide all the raw data and labeled data. [Dataset detail and download](http://apolloscape.auto/tracking.html)

## Evaluation
eval.py is the evaluation code. gtPath is (label) and dtPath is (Your detection/tracking result). Here we have not provide sample label data. You may use traing label and data, but we encourage user to submit result directly to apolloscape website to get a score.

```
# export NUMBA_ENABLE_CUDASIM=1

# detection
python eval.py --gtPath= xx --dtPath= xx  

# tracking
# python eval.py --modeType=tracking --gtPath= xx --dtPath= xx
```

## Format of submission file
Submit your result for online evaluation here: [Submit](http://apolloscape.auto/submit.html)   [Leaderboard](http://apolloscape.auto/leader_board.html)

1) 3D detection

Please submit one detection_result.zip file. In this zip file, you have one folder named detection_result, under this folder, you have multiple subfolders follow the same name in test_pcd, under each subfolder are result txt files of that sequence:

detection_result

├── 9048_2

├── ├── 2.txt

├── ├── 7.txt

...

├── ├── 462.txt

...

├── 9049_1

...

├── 9063_10

...

- Each line in every file contains object_type, position_x, position_y, position_z, object_length, object_width, object_height, heading, score. score indicates confidence in detection results.
- Each file name is frame_id name, which should be same as pcd frame id we provide in test_pcd. Each pcd file should have a corresponding result file. Total test result should be 5400 txt files.
- Please only keep type 1/2/3/4 in your result file. We do evaluation just for Car (type 1 and 2), Pedestrian (type 3) and Cyclist (type 4).

2) 3D tracking

Please submit one tracking_result.zip file. Folder and subfolders structure and file name are same to detection_result, but we need object_id in file.
- Each line in every file contains object_id, object_type, position_x, position_y, position_z, object_length, object_width, object_height, heading, score
